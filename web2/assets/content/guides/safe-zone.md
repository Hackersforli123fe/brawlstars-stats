Control Comp

Control, control, control the map! Poking the enemy team is more important than the safe. Attack the safe only when you have enough space.

### Thrower

Control and poke the enemy safe from a safe place.

Zoning and poking are both equally important. Try not to lose too much area when dying. The diver must jump in whenever their super is ready.

### Support

Control the map as main job.

Dive the objective as a team if possible. Attacking is more important than defending. Try to win the base race!
